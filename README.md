## :dart: About ##

fbAPI is a simple API made for 'FizzBuzzing' that means it is just a simple way to fizz buzz one or more numbers.
This API was build after the Idea of CodingSloth ([I can recommend his Newsletter btw.](https://slothbytes.beehiiv.com/subscribe?ref=leLwLkdsZI)).
And it is just meant as a simple exercise, since I don't think this can ever come in handy.

## :sparkles: Features ##

> Just to be clear this has a lot of features that you right now have to find in source.
> I will provide a more in depth documentation later on but right now I'm sorry but it is what it is.
